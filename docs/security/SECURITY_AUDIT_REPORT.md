## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Firebase API Key Exposure
**Severity**: Critical  
**Location**: `OmniAI/GoogleService-Info.plist:6`  
**CVE/CWE**: CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)

#### Description
The Firebase API key is exposed in the GoogleService-Info.plist file included in the app bundle. While Firebase keys are designed to be public, they still pose risks without proper restrictions.

#### Impact
- API abuse if Firebase Security Rules are misconfigured
- Quota exhaustion attacks
- Infrastructure details exposure

#### Evidence
```xml
<key>API_KEY</key>
<string>AIzaSyBlw1nOxqwPGk6yVWWiZdGy3dZc6Mo9DAo</string>
```

#### Remediation
1. ✅ Implemented Firebase App Check
2. ✅ Configured API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console
3. ✅ Monitoring API usage patterns
4. ✅ Using environment-specific configurations

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED in Build 29

### 2. OpenAI API Key Security
**Severity**: Critical  
**Location**: `functions/src/index.ts:15,38`  
**CVE/CWE**: CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials)

#### Description
OpenAI API key stored as Firebase secret but accessed directly in Cloud Functions without additional security layers.

#### Impact
- Financial loss from unauthorized API usage
- Data exfiltration risk
- Service disruption

#### Evidence
```typescript
const openaiApiKey = defineSecret("OPENAI_API_KEY");
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: openaiApiKey.value(),
});
```

#### Remediation
- Implement rate limiting per user
- Add request validation
- Create key rotation mechanism
- Add usage monitoring and alerting

---

### 3. Input Validation Vulnerability
**Severity**: Critical  
**Location**: `functions/src/index.ts:70-75`  
**CVE/CWE**: CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)

#### Description
Cloud Functions accept user input without sanitization, vulnerable to prompt injection attacks.

#### Impact
- AI response manipulation
- Content filter bypass
- Generation of harmful content

#### Evidence
```typescript
const {message, sessionId, mood} = request.body;
// No sanitization before sending to OpenAI
```

#### Remediation
- Implement input sanitization
- Add content moderation
- Validate message length and format
- Filter injection patterns

---

## High Priority Issues

### 1. Weak Guest User Restrictions
**Severity**: High  
**Location**: `functions/src/index.ts:78-160`  
**CVE/CWE**: CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass)

#### Description
Daily message limit (3 messages) can be bypassed by creating new anonymous sessions.

#### Remediation
- Implement device fingerprinting
- Add IP-based rate limiting
- Track usage across sessions

---

### 2. Missing Certificate Pinning
**Severity**: High  
**Location**: `OmniAI/Services/ChatService.swift:376`  
**CVE/CWE**: CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation)

#### Description
URLSession.shared used without certificate pinning, vulnerable to MITM attacks.

#### Remediation
```swift
// Implement certificate pinning
class PinnedURLSession: NSObject, URLSessionDelegate {
    func urlSession(_ session: URLSession, 
                   didReceive challenge: URLAuthenticationChallenge,
                   completionHandler: @escaping (URLSession.AuthChallengeDisposition, URLCredential?) -> Void) {
        // Verify certificate chain
    }
}
```

---

### 3. Insecure Data Storage
**Severity**: High  
**Location**: Multiple files including `OfflineManager.swift`  
**CVE/CWE**: CWE-922 (Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information)

#### Description
UserDefaults used for potentially sensitive data instead of Keychain.

#### Remediation
- Migrate all sensitive data to KeychainManager
- Encrypt data at rest
- Clear UserDefaults of sensitive information

---

### 4. Insufficient Audit Logging
**Severity**: High  
**Location**: `OmniAI/Services/EncryptionManager.swift:131-145`  
**CVE/CWE**: CWE-778 (Insufficient Logging)

#### Description
Audit logging only in DEBUG mode, doesn't persist securely.

#### Remediation
- Implement production audit logging
- Send logs to secure backend
- Include security events

---

### 5. Missing Biometric Authentication
**Severity**: High  
**Location**: Not implemented  
**CVE/CWE**: CWE-287 (Improper Authentication)

#### Description
Biometric authentication referenced but not implemented.

#### Remediation
- Implement LocalAuthentication framework
- Add Face ID/Touch ID support
- Provide fallback mechanisms

---

## Medium Priority Issues

### 1. Firebase Security Rules
**Location**: Firebase Console  
**Issue**: Rules lack field-level validation and rate limiting

### 2. App Transport Security
**Location**: Info.plist  
**Issue**: ATS configuration not explicitly defined

### 3. Webhook Validation
**Location**: RevenueCat integration  
**Issue**: Simple string comparison instead of cryptographic verification

### 4. Encryption at Rest
**Location**: Message storage  
**Issue**: EncryptionManager exists but not actively used

---

## Low Priority Issues

### 1. Hardcoded Bundle Identifier
**Location**: Multiple files  
**Issue**: "com.jns.Omni" hardcoded

### 2. Privacy Manifest
**Location**: Missing  
**Issue**: Required for App Store

### 3. Verbose Error Messages
**Location**: Various  
**Issue**: System details exposed

## Security Architecture Recommendations

### 1. Defense in Depth
```
[Client App] -> [Certificate Pinning] -> [API Gateway] -> [Cloud Functions] -> [Firebase]
     ↓              ↓                        ↓                ↓                  ↓
[Encryption]  [Rate Limiting]      [Authentication]   [Validation]      [Security Rules]
```

### 2. Zero Trust Model
- Verify every request
- Assume breach mindset
- Least privilege principle
- Continuous validation

### 3. Data Protection
- Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Key rotation (30 days)
- Secure key storage (Keychain)
